# Toronto Bikeshare Data Analysis (2018)

## Overview
This project analyzes the Toronto Bikeshare dataset for the year 2018. The dataset contains information about bikeshare trips in Toronto, including start and end station details, trip duration, and bike IDs. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into bikeshare usage patterns and trends in Toronto for the year 2018.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilbalagopal/toronto-bikeshare-data). It includes data on bikeshare trips in Toronto from 2017 to 2020. For this analysis, we focused specifically on the data for the year 2018.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed initially using Microsoft Excel. This involved tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting the data for analysis. The cleaned dataset was then used for further analysis in Python and Tableau.

## Data Analysis
### Python Analysis
Python was used for initial exploratory data analysis and visualization. Jupyter Notebooks were utilized to clean and preprocess the data, perform statistical analysis, and create visualizations using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Tableau Visualization
Tableau was employed for more in-depth visualization and exploration of the bikeshare data. Various visualizations were created to analyze trip duration, start and end station distributions, time trends, and other relevant insights.

## Repository Structure
- **data**: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
- **notebooks**: Includes Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning and Python analysis.
- **visualizations**: Contains Tableau workbooks and images of visualizations created.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for replicating the analysis.

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Perform data cleaning using Microsoft Excel or any preferred tool.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for Python analysis.
4. Open the Tableau workbooks in the `visualizations` directory for interactive visualizations.
